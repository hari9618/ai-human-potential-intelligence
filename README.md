## 🧠 Overview  

Can we predict high-performance human potential using Deep Learning?

This project presents an AI-powered talent intelligence system built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict high-performance potential based on behavioral and cognitive indicators.

The system compares a traditional Machine Learning baseline model (Logistic Regression) with a Deep Neural Network to demonstrate how nonlinear modeling improves predictive performance.
